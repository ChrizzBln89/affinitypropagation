(Cayman), through its subsidiaries, produces and sells epitaxy wafers of compound semiconductor for use in wireless communications, data transmission and national defense in the United States, Germany, China, Japan, Korea, and internationally. The company utilizes its proprietary real-time in situ growth monitoring technology on molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) systems for the manufacturing of epi-wafers on gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) substrates. Its GaAs-based products include pseudo-morpic high electron mobility transistors and MHEMT products; and InP-based products comprise hetero-junction bi-polar transistors, HEMT, RTT, and RTD. The company also provides Sb based products, such as type II SLS photodetectors, GaAsSb-base InP HBT, and epi-ready GaSb substrates; and mismatched Epi products comprising III-V on Si, III-V on Ge, and high in content InGaAs on Si. In addition, it offers optoelectronics, including avalanche photo diodes, lasers, high-speed high-frequency surface-emitting lasers, optical receivers, quantum well-infrared photodetectors, modulators, and quantum cascade lasers, as well as infrared light detectors. The company was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Richardson, Texas.",84,"{'maxAge': 1, 'name': 'Dr. Yung-Chung  Kao', 'title': 'Chairman, Pres & CEO', 'exercisedValue': 0, 'unexercisedValue': 0}",86400,2,60.0,59.5,59.0,60.2,60.0,59.5,59.0,60.2,2.0,0.0335,1690416000,1.5465,2.25,0.733377,61.443295,44002,44002,86492,90600,90600,59.4,59.6,0,0,2161852928,51.4,76.0,3.0557823,57.86,58.365,1.998,0.0333,TWD,1991561344,0.050669998,36272700,0.31189,0.018660001,45.167,1.3195474,1672444800,1703980800,1688083200,35847000,0.97,1050:1000,1468886400,2.815,15.922,TWO,EQUITY,4971.TWO,4971.TWO,INTELLIEPI INC (CAYMAN),IntelliEPI Inc.
